#AcmeQueryBox
This is a command line interface for searching coordinate data inside of a bounding box.

Starting the file from the command line will load in the data from the sample_data.csv file included and then ask for the
dimensions of the bounding box. The results will be written to a file called query_results.txt. This program lets you do multiple
queries.
